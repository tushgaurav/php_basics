## What is PHP?

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language that is primarily used to create server-side web applications.

## History of PHP

PHP was created by **Rasmus Lerdorf** in 1995. Initially, it was a set of Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts written in the C programming language that Lerdorf used to maintain his personal website. He named the set of scripts **"Personal Home Page Tools"** which later became known as **"PHP."**

Over time, Lerdorf extended the functionality of PHP and eventually released the source code to the public in 1995. This led to the development of a community of developers who contributed to the language's evolution. In 1997, Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski rewrote the core of PHP, creating a new version of the language known as PHP 3.0. This version included improved performance and support for object-oriented programming.

In the following years, PHP continued to evolve and improve, with new versions being released regularly.

- PHP 4 was released in 2000.
- PHP 5 was released in 2004.
- In 2014, PHP 7 was released, which included new features such as improved performance and support for 64-bit integers.

> Today, PHP is **one of the most popular** programming languages for web development. It is used to power many of the world's most popular websites, including Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress. The latest version of PHP is 8.0 which was released in November 2020.

## Features of PHP

PHP has a wide range of features that make it a popular choice for web development. Some of these features include:

- **Server-side scripting:** PHP is a server-side scripting language, which means that the code is executed on the server rather than the client's browser.

- **Cross-platform compatibility:** PHP can be run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

- **Database integration:** PHP has built-in support for many popular databases, including MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

- **Open-source:** PHP is open-source software, which means that it is free to use and distribute.

- **Built-in support for web protocols:** PHP has built-in support for web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS, making it easy to interact with web servers.

- **Large community:** PHP has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the language and its ecosystem.

- **Object-oriented programming:** PHP supports object-oriented programming (OOP) and has a wide range of built-in classes and functions that can be used to create more complex, object-oriented applications.

- **Error handling:** PHP provides built-in functions for handling errors and exceptions, which makes it easier to debug and troubleshoot code.

- **Caching:** With the help of caching techniques like opcode caching, PHP can improve the performance of web applications.

- **Integration with other languages:** PHP can be integrated with other languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
